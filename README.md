 **2. Explore the Welcome page** \
 At the top of the page there are seven tabs that correspond to different types of analysis that you can perform on an amino acid sequence.
 
 The *Search* programs in the Bioinformatics Toolkit are the following:
  - HHblits
  - HHpred
  - HMMER
  - PatternSearch
  - ProtBLAST/PSI-BLAST
  
Hover over the name of the programs to get a short description of what they do.
