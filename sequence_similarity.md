“If the amino acid sequences of two proteins are set side by side in one-to-one correspondence, there may occur an abnormally large number of pairs containing the same amino acid.”
> Walter Fitch. J Mol Biol. 1966


## BLAST

**Extreme-value distribution.** The human dual specificity protein phosphatase 12 (DUS12_HUMAN) was compared to 38,114 human RefSeq proteins using the SSEARCH program. The distribution of bit-scores for all 38,114 alignments is shown (squares, □) as well as the mathematically expected distribution of normalized similarity scores (z-scores, or standard deviations above and below the mean 0) based on the size of the database, using the extreme-value distribution. The close agreement between the observed and expected distribution of scores reflects the observation that the distribution of unrelated sequence scores is indistinguishable from random (mathematically generated) scores, so sequences with significant sequence similarity can be inferred to be not-unrelated, or homologous.
